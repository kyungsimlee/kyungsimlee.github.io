<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>PERSONAL INFORMATION</u></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Name: (April) Kyung Sim Lee</p>
<p>Student #: s3788003</p>
<p>Email address: <a href="mailto:s3788003@student.rmit.edu.au">s3788003@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am 1.5 generation, have migrated from South Korea to Sydney, Australia in year 2007. I am bilingual, speaking both Korean and English at home. Before commencing my study here in RMIT university, I have studied and graduated diploma course in hospitality and commercial cookery and worked in industry for quite few years. One interesting fact about me would be that I have experienced living in variety of cities and countries giving me chance to explore different cultures while growing up. I left Korea since age of 12 then I resided in Fiji Islands in South Pacific region where I have spent my junior high school years. I have to say it was quite an extraordinary experience living in a slow rhythmic life in one of Islands in Pacific Ocean where nature is one of your best friends. As for my hobbies, I love swimming and going to beach for a walk and of course cooking. During late high school years, I migrated to Sydney and only recently I have been residing in Melbourne city.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>INTEREST IN IT</u></h2>
<p>Frankly, computers and Information Technology were quite complex area where I found it as foreign industry. I considered main use of IT was purely for enjoyment such as internet surfing and playing games.</p>
<p>However, since phenomenal YouTube has hit the world providing general public a &lsquo;platform&rsquo; for personal broadcasting where individuals are able to create their own contents and to broadcast in internet. I was stroked how powerful IT now can be that it has revolutionized in such way to influence our daily life. I started paying more attention to how deeply connected our everyday dependency was on IT and how painfully difficult it would be to carry out even a single day without it. This flared my interest in IT field, I wanted to discover where the possibilities can immense till. Then I started watching documentaries and forums on AI, 3-D Printing and how programming language will be a 2<sup>nd</sup> language for future generation. I certainly initiated the significance of IT for our life now and vast possibilities for future. And I simply wanted to be part of that future.</p>
<p>I chose RMIT as it has good reputation on IT education area providing variety courses and opportunities for students.</p>
<p>I expect to learn practical skills I can implement in working when I graduate. As well as to grab chances to explore diverse regions of IT field where I might not even have idea of.</p>

<p>IT Consultant: An IT consultant usually works for a consulting company or individually. Also known as technology consultants, they are contracted to work with industrial and commercial clients seeking help and advice for their business&rsquo;s problem areas of IT system or to analyse IT system for improvement.

<p><em>What does these test mean?</em></p>
<p>Test result says I am a visual learner, where I understand and remember things by sight. I learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. This shows that I should use learning methods such as using key words, ideas, or instructions with mind mapping will maximise my outcome in working environment.</p>
<p><em>How in these tests influence your behaviour in a team?</em></p>
<p>My test result shows that I am an adventurer who enjoys upsetting traditional expectations with experiments. Observant of others feeling and behaviour who enjoys connecting with different personalities but can be quite weak on harsh criticism. This conveys that I should have rather constructive ideals to base my goals on and work out goals that can create positive principles. I should draw limits on how much I can take on people and do not let emotion take control of situations I can face in team play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
						<h2 style="text-align: center;">Project Idea</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Overview</em></p>
<p>My project idea is to develop a smartphone application that can connect &lsquo;food production services&rsquo; (such as caf&eacute;/restaurant/catering) to &lsquo;customers&rsquo;. Where customers can get involved in designing their food order according to needed nutrient intake or any specifications they may have. Customers can get involved in designing their food order from scratch starting from types of ingredients; methods of cooking; controlling sodium, fat and sugar content of the dish; to any unnatural chemicals added, for example hormone free meat; GMO free; MSG free etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Motivation</em></p>
<p>As &lsquo;well-being&rsquo; living trends growing especially in food industry I think it will be worthwhile project to invest on as there is demand for target market. It is statically proven there is increasing consciousness of general public who are attentive to their daily nutrient intake. Also, as there is escalation of associated diseases of bad eating habits and having aged population requiring the need to control their daily nutrient consumption this smartphone&nbsp; application can be a good contributor for solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Description</em></p>
<p>Functions of this smartphone application would include;&nbsp; Customers are to design their food order from 1.) choosing ingredients (this can be types of ingredients to weather it is organic or not). 2.) adjusting fat/sugar/salt contents of the dish as well as any additional chemicals added for flavoring. 3.) preferred methods of cooking will be selected for the dish. (stir-frying, steaming etc.) 4.) delivery option is to be chosen. These are basic 4 simple steps that would be carried out to use this application. An additional feature is that what customers consumed as their food order can be collected as referential data for individual&rsquo;s consumption on Nutrients. Furthermore, this can produce personalized reports in regular basis for recommended daily nutrient intake. Because this product requires first users to have background knowledge on food to design their order. A basic educating tutorial videos and texts will be provided for customers to utilize the application effectively. There will be templates offered for food orders with suggestive nutrient intake designed accordingly addressing various health issues for instance obesity and diabetes.One other additional feature will be having opportunities for complex linkage of different applications to improve life convenience. For example, this application can be connected to doctors and hospitals for referential information. This collected information can be utilized to develop another innovative application that can allow individuals to have a personalized nutritionist who can monitor and direct to achieve a balanced diet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Tools and Technologies</em></p>
<p>There is no requirement of hardware other than computer and mobile phone to create this product. Software that are needed for development would be different depending on whether this application is for iPhone or android phone. Tools required are as follows; Application development tools for iPhone: iOS specific technologies, like iOS SDK and others are used to develop applications for Apple mobile devices. iOS technologies are available with variety of development tools, like iOS stimulator, Objective C, Xcode etc. JavaScript, CSS and HTML are frequently used programming languages for building and deploying web-based iPhone applications. Application development tools for Android: Development for Android application rely on Android SDK. The Android specific development toolkit is primarily composed of two important components. One is Android Development Tools Plugin for Eclipse and the other one is Android emulator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Skills Required</em></p>
<p>Referring to Tools and Technologies from above, basic compulsory skill required is Programming skills (coding). Such as C#, Java and trained in web development languages like HTML 5 and CSS. And as well as familiarized with mobile platform application programming interfaces (API) for example Apple iOS, Android. Secondly, important aspect of mobile app development would be building a high-quality user interface (UI). This is simply smooth interaction between the user and the software itself. Good practical experience in programming will be needed to achieve this. Overall it is feasible to find skills, software and hardware to launch this project.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Outcome</em></p>
<p>If my project is successful, the outcome will offer more options to general public on healthy eating. This will promote good eating habits as it is easy to plan and have balanced diet via using this application. Individuals with less to serious health issues will benefit by having more affordable personalized meal planner for their specific dietary needs. Furthermore, this app will open opportunities for complex linkage of different apps to improve life convenience. For example, this application can be connected to doctors and hospitals for referential information.</p>
